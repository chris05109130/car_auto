Welcome to my project called Car Auto

The reason for this project is because I wanted to learn CSS Grid, and by doing this project will show you I know how to use CSS grid the correct Way. 

What does this project exactly detail?

I basically just picked a random car online which in this case is a camaro. If it was actually used online in a car website you would be able to go on and find every piece of information you need to see about the car. Such as details, price, leasing and much more. Now this project is only one page but at the same time it correctly shows what the topic at hand is about. 

Some of the CSS grid elements that I used was

1.display:grid;
2.grid-template-columns
3.justify-ccontent
4.align-content
5.grid-template-areas
6.grid-area
7:gap
